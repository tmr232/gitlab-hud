# Gitlab HUD

This is a small utility to make my working with Gitlab MRs easier.

This is in the "personal project" state, so breaking changes & bugs are
to be expected at high frequency.

Some friends asked me for the code, so I made it public.

No proper installation instructions yet, but the pipfile holds all the
relevant dependencies.

Bug reports & feature suggstions are welcome, but no promises.
